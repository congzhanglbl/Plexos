Description: Efficiently read and analyze 'PLEXOS' solutions by converting
    them into 'SQLite' databases that can be easily queried. It supports collation
    of solutions that may have been divided into different time partitions, as
    well as the comparison across different scenarios. 'PLEXOS' is a power systems
    production cost model, created and distributed by Energy Exemplar (see <http://energyexemplar.com/software/plexos-desktop-edition>
    for more information).
